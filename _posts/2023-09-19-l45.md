_Two molecules that the model has a high loss on, regardless of what additional edges we introduce._

This was the final coursework I submitted for one of [the 5 research modules](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2223/L45) I took during my Master's year at the University of Cambridge.

Equivariant graph neural networks are part of a larger family of ML models called [geometric deep learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com), and are often employed in molecular tasks that use [protein structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure). These models are powerful, but sometimes struggle to properly model _long-range interactions_ between nodes. This is a problem that is known in the literature of graph neural networks as [oversquashing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05205). 

[Chroma](https://generatebiomedicines.com/chroma) is a generative model in which the aforementioned problem is circumvented through the addition of new random edges between far-away nodes in the atom graph of each molecule. Since the authors do not provide either theoretical nor empirical justifications on why the addition of random edges improves performance, our[^1] project aims to fill this research gap and _quantify_ what is the impact of adding these long-range edges. 

The **key takeaway** of our project is that random edges do **not** improve performance on the specific dataset[^2] we chose to experiment with. However, this dataset contains molecules that are much smaller than the ones the [Chroma](https://generatebiomedicines.com/chroma) model works with. Therefore, we could better say that _long-range interactions are not a performance bottleneck for small molecules_.
